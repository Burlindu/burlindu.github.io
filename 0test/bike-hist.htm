grade 8 from Canadian Tire
<br>mom said I could get the proper adult bike if I wanted
<br>It was too big & had a suede seat
<br>I loved it and kept it through undergrad
<br>(I added a hilarious tremclad multicolour paintjob, each tube a different colour)

The Kona was stolen from outside the house on Stewart St
<br>Undergrad 3rd year - I was living at small Water St apartment
<br>Insurance fellow snuck this upgrade in
<br>Richey tubes, top mount shifters
<br>Lovely Richey grips, classic Avocet seat
<br> Was just classic, top to bottom<br> got 17" (there was no 18") - but was short so swapped to crazy long aluminum specialized stem
<br> The new stem damaged the handling (made too fast) but looked pretty wild
<br>[Shown is a 19" Sky on sale on FB for $800]
<br>Stolen from basement on Manning during house break-in

2004? Red Peugot (1970's)
<div class="text2">
<a href="images/bikes/mybikes/image-04.jpg">FULL SIZE IMAGE</a>
Unsure of date. Earliest pic 2007
<br>I think the Breezer was stolen, I got that knock-off generic grey 10-speed on Spadina & that was stolen in the summer staying at mom's before UofT year 1. 2004/5? 
<br>Peugot from Bikes on Wheels, Kensington, $150
<br>I upgraded the seat (Origin 8) and bar tape, removed front derailer. Orig textured rims & iffy C-Pull brakes
<br>I think had vintage dried leather orig seat (!) that was stolen when I met AO downtown one night (ride home with no seat is difficult)
<br>New smooth continental tires, wow looked great
<br>Sold for $150 to tall hipster with toque perched on his head in summer
<br> Very cool bike but too slim and fragile for full city use
</div></div></div>

<a href="images/bikes/mybikes/image-10.jpg">FULL SIZE IMAGE</a>
Picked up as freebee outside of neighbourhood house
<br>Needs some work but solid
<br>Had really ugly decals, looks great after heat gun remove
<br>700C and tall frame but could be ideal 'risk area' overnight bike

Modern Slack Cruiser
<br>Rivendale lists all measurements - angles areound 70-72ish
<br>They use a long trailing back triangle, say makes a big difference
<br>Premium frames but likely suit my type (if theft risk)
