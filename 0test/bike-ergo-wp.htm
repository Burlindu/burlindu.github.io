(1)
<br>
Bicycle size depends on 2 things: 
<br>
Length and Height
<br>
<br>
(2)
<br>
These 2 have to be alterable independatlly, as a person with shorter arms or torso or wanting to sit more upright may require a shorter bike. 
<br>
A person with longer legs or wanting a racier body position may require a taller bike. 
<br>
<br>
(3)
<br>
Changing the bike length should not force the user to alter the height. Altering the height should not force an altreration of the length.

<hr>

Racing position means leaning forward which lengthens the bike.
<br>
City position is upright, shortening the bike.
<br>
<br>
Slacker head tubes makes for more control and steadiness in the turns (shrper is quicker).
<br>
<br>
Slack seat tube makes for a more relaxed pedaling position. *** Often riders have the seat too far forward, moving the rider very for forward over the pedal, simpley because the bike is too long (ie racing length framme on a casual rider)
<br>
Seat tube and Head tube should be the same angle so that raising or lowering these 2 keeps them the same distance apart (when measuring at level,. There should be no length penalty for raising or lowering teh seat or the bars.

Step Through Ladies' bikes
<br>
<br>
A postulate that the idea that a Ladies' bike has a lower crossbar is developed from the wonderful idea of making all bikes with a crazy high crossbar and then not making small bikes for small people. And women are on average smaller than men. 
<br>
In my vast experience of having a groin I would say that a man also, in addition to the feelings of the ladies, does not like to hit their groin area on  a crossbar. However, if you design most bikes so that a levelish crossbar will hit the groin of people under 5'8, and way more women than men are under 5'8, than suddenly you will have to make a 'ladies' bike with a lower crossbar or a step-through design. It's not a question of gender; it's a question of bike manufacturers just contyinually making bikes with a high crossbar - and oversize frames and wheels -like it was still the olden days, which it is not.
