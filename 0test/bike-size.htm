Example of bike sizing from Sam Hilborne - 
<br>
hard to judge sizes when they show different pics of the 'same' frame that look wildly different because the large has a massive head tube and standover and the small has a tidy triangle and good standover - and none of these pics are labelled as to size. Makes it hard
<br>
[note all these from same clcycle.ca site on same day, same bike listing]

Note also the SM is a road handlebar
<br>
And the XL is a City handlebar
<br>
So the ROAD layout has the grip LOWER and AHEAD of the red line - the meet of head and top tubes
<br>
The CITY layout has the grip waaay back and higher - 
<br>
so here the 'SMALLER' frame gets lengthened and the "XL' frame gets shorter.
<br>
Like way shorter. It's like they are both trying to be 'medium' bikes.
<br><br>
So (DUH! - sorry Rivendell) the number we need in addition to that frame length is around what our seat to grip length would be................
<br>
<br>
So I added Y AXIS - 
<br>
Y is the same in both images.
<br>
For the SM frame it is seat-yo-grip (ROAD BARS)
<br>
For the XL frame it is seat-to....beyond grip (CITY BARS)
<br>
CONCLUSION: The actual reach (seat-to-grip) on the SM road bike is longer than on the XL City bike. If sizing seems dumb/hard using the seat tube length, it is also iffy when using the top tube length, given tgat a higher seat is furthur back and and city bar may be way behind a road bar.
<br>
<br>
WE NEED TO SEPARATE BIKE FRAME HEIGHT AND BIKE FRAME LENGTH BECAUSE THE SAME HEIGHT RIDER MAY WANT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT BIKE LENGTH DEPENDING ON RIDE STYLE (RACE OR COMFORT) - AND THE LISTINGS SHOW 'SIZE' BY BASICALLY SEAT TUBE LENGTH WHICH IS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT FOR THIS (OR MOSTLY IRRELEVANT)
