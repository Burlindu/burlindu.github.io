<span class="font200">BREEZER SKY 1991</span>
<span class="regcase">

<br><br>
My Kona Lava Dome was stolen in Peterborough - I think from outside my girlfriend's house - however luckily it was covered by my mom's house insurance. I had got the Lava Dome on sale (end of year) and was concerned I would have to 'model-down' to the same (lower) price range. Insurance companies, I discovered, do not not think like that and considered my massive $700 claim to be totally inconsequential. Good for me.
<br><br>
The shop I went to in Toronto had the new Konas - but at the momenet before sale the guy said - or, if you want, I can sell this bike to the insurance company as a fair equivalent. It's a Breezer Sky. 
<br><br>
(This would involve I think some Bike store shenanigans, which I did not really understand at the time, being like 20 or 21. The Breezer is clearly a step up up from a low-mid-range Kona)
<br><br>
The Kona was a 19" and a bit long; it 'pulled' me a bit as a rode. The Breezer came in 19 and 17. I wanted an 18, which did not exist. I took the 17. It was indeed a little short however I wanted too short rather than too long. I went back a few weeks later and asked if we could do anything. He proposed 'this!' - a hilariously long polished aluminum Specialized stem. I am sure, in retrospect, he had it lying around and wantted to get rid of it. It was too long. I said 'OK', because I had no idea what he/I was talking about. It was too long and took the unbeleivably perfect steering of the Sky and made it too twitchy, but it did stretch me out and looked hilariously cool. I was set. 
<br><br>
The Breezer was a special bike. A perfect, tidy tight (small head tube, level top tube) main triangle with logic tubing. Light and nimble. Wonderful 1991-ish geoetry, meaning head and seat tubes around 70 - 73 degrees, a carry over from cruiser days (rather than being road bike like). And just all put togethr so well. The paint, with the arrows around the welds, looked simply amazing. Joe Breeze, ya done good.
<br><br>
The last thing the Breezer Sky had was that special quality in a  bike. It was love. Now I loved the Kona too, with it's (for then) wild big head tube and sloping top tube. The Kona was sexy and fun and rambunctious. But the Breezer was poetry - calm, elegent, smooth, refined and joyful - my Ekaterina Gordeeva of bicycles. As 1991 Mountain Bike Action said:
