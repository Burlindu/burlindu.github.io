 HANDLEBAR & SEAT STUFF
 <hr>
 Handlebars really means Handlebar + Stem.
 <br>
 I Like the grip lined up with the fork / stem, so the lunge forward via the stem has to be countered by a drop back on the handlebar, so the grips are centered where the stem starts.
 <br>
 <br>
 Seats - I just like the best priced track style seat that is narrow & dead flat. There are surprising deals on seats that I think are pretty much perfect, look super professional, and cost very little. Selle San Marco sells a flat track style seat for like $36. $36.
 <br>
 <br>
 I have MAYBE 150mm of grip area on the glider (ie dead straight clean bar). I would like say 200mm to allow stuff like a SWYTCH throttle. Currently the 150 handles my short (90mm) grips, my twist shift and my lean retro brake levers (and a bell on the other side instead of the twist shifter)
 <br>
 <br>
 Also I want lots of horizontal area on the bar to mount cup holders, a phone and a SWYTCH battery. And a SWYTCH display. And a light of course

 The 500mm overall width is taken from the GLIDEr - those nifty narrow bars are clearly way better in traffic than something like the schoolbus-wide stock LINUS bar. 
 <br>
 <br>
 BUT - the extra curviness of typical retro English bars like mine just don't have enough straight mounting area. Why have the curve of the bar both take away mounting area AND at the same time mearly be reversing the forward push of the stem? Straighten the handlebar and lengthen the stem - and you get any handle position you want with lots of straight area for mounts.
