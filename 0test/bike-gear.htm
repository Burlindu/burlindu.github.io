Glider Gear Hub & Ratios
<hr>
<br>
My 1966 Glider has the original Sturmey Archer 3-speed Hub with a new modern wheel (in the original size).
<br>
The final metric for gear ratios and how it effects the bike performance is how much distance on the ground is covered for each petal rotation. 
<br><br>
<b>METER DEVELOPMENT</b>
<br><br>
Meter Development is the awkward term for the rolling circumference of the tire (ie equal to the amount of distance the bike will travel in one rotation). For my glider it's a 3-speed 26" wheel with an ETRTO of 590mm, and a 26 1 3/8 tire that is about 35mm. so a 590-35 tire has a diameter of 590+35+35=660mm (which happens to equal pretty much exactly 26")
<br><br>
The key thing is the gear ratio from the pedal to the turning wheel, however the wheel & tire size will also have some effect on how much power needs to be applied for a given ride.
<br><br>
<b>GEAR RATIOS</b>
<br><br>
My Glider runs in mid gear at a basic 1:2.5 ratio. The big ring at the cranks is 2.5 bigger (measured in teeth - has 2.5 times as many teeth) as the small sprocket ring on the hub. So one turn of the pedals will rotate the tire 2.5 times.
<br><br>
Note this take place because of the visible gear. The internal hub also has gears, however the mid gear is 1:1 so has no effect. The low gear is 75% and the big gear is 133%. 
<br><br>
This is how the internal gear bike differs from the external gear bike. The internal gear bike has 2 visible gears with a set ratio, and gear changes happen internally in addition/combination with that set external ratio. 
<br><br>
Conventional external derailleurs do not have a set primary ratio, just a front ring or rings that the back hub rings refer to. So in a sense the 2 visible gears on an internal hub bike equate to the front gear on a regular external derailleur bike. <br><br>
The external gear bike is simpler because there are only 2 rotating points and not 3; the internal geared bike is simpler because it has only one isolated component of changing variables with the other (external) gears merely serving to transport torque from the pedal to the rear of the bike. The gear system on external derailleurs has 2 contact that serve for transport AND ratio change; on the internal system the are 3 contact points that serve for transport OR ratio change.
