<span class="font200">Eaton's Glider 1966</span>
<span class="regcase">
<br><br>
I bought the Glider on Craig's List, 2012. My Champange Miele was stolen downtown and I wanted an 'old chinese man's bike' - literally, a people's urban city bike. Not fast, not for mountains.  For being a city person going around doing city things. Upright, dignified, and dressed like a regular urban person.
<br><br>
First I bought a beater cruiser from Bike Pirates. It was shoert, a bit rough, had the most comfortable sprung padded seat ever made, and was $150. It was a good test, but really a bit of a crappy bike. But fun. I discovered that instead of stopping hunting for used 3 speeds my search increased after I got the raliegh beater. It turned, as is often the case, there was a 'market breaking point'. Used town cruisers (vintage 3 speeds) floated around teh $150 - $200 mark. $250 immediately, for only $50 more, put you in the premium market. The red 3 speed glider looked immaculate in the ad - it was a retired gentklement who had restored the bike in his garage. He and his wife met me at the University libarary for the purchase. The Ruby paint and chrome bit shone in the sun. 
<br><br>
The Glider had a proper refurb/restore. The pedals and tires were original - but pretty shot. The seat post was vintage, which means, just pretty bad. The spring seat would not stay level and made a bit of noise. New pedals, new post and seat. I offended the awesome hipsters at Curbside Bikes by suggesting I would replace the original white fenders - beautiful but made it look like a kid's bike - with Curbside's nifty flat steel versions. So I went back later and bought the new fenders incognito. 
<br><br>
The four highlights of the Glider are:
<br>
(1) It's in awesome shape for a 50+ year bike
<br>
(2) The old school size and geometry and wonderful for rising around town
<br>
It's beautiful. The paint is sharp, the geometry is classic. The handlebars are just right (new cruiser handbars and invariably way too big, ideal for clipping a passing car or bus)
<br>
Lastly, it has a rare 1966 twist-grip shifter. Sheldon Brown himself said these did not take off as they were problematic. I Dunno. Mine is 100% original and it works amazing. Yes the cable needs fine turing fairly regularly to hit the sweet spot, but 3 speeds, interally geared, on a full hand twist grip is amazing in the city.
<br><br>
<br><br>
The Glider has been my primary bike for more than 10 years. The tires and now (26 x 1 3/8 - ETRTO 590) Delta Cruisers and double basil panniers complete the 'usability upgrade' of this vintage utility bike. The cupholder is from Curbside, billet aluminum. The Urbane Cyclist built me a new rear wheel around the original hub when the old rim split. The questionable and mediocre flimsey side-pull brakes from 1969 are still good enough for everyday (and I mean every single day) downtown use. 
<br><br>
Like the Breezer, the Glider is a beauty and inspires affection. It's quite normal for pedestrians and other cyclists to stop to tell me how beautiful the bike is. They are correct. 
<br><br>
I would consider:
<br>
- swapping to 650B wheels so I could add slighter deeper tires. 650B would give be a BSD of 584 instead of current 590 - an extra few mm. I'd like Continental Utrban Contact (real semi-slick urban tires) at 422mm rather than my 590-73 Deltas. 584+42(x2)=668 compared to 590=37(x2)=664 - I think I can affort a 4mm loss. I think. I also want an electric front wheel from SWYTCH - that would be a new wheel in any case. Too bad I had that rear wheel rebuilt as a 590 instead of switching to the more modern and slightly smaller 584's. 
<br>
- New wheels wouldben new, slightly longer throw brakes. That would be welcome anyway; much better newer, beefier (& still polished aluminum) brakes are widely available.
- I'd also like a better backup bike. I got rid of teh wall-hanging Peugiot and have in storage a quite low-grade raleigh (in need fo work) - I'd like a proper 'tiough' bike, either brand new or a hipster rebuilt 1990's MTB. That $900 Breezer Sky on FB sure looked nice - but there are lots of $150-$400 Marins and Norcos etc etc that could always be had and built up
<br><br>
Lastly, on pedigree:
<br>
I hunted for ages for the date of the Glider. The hub has only a '6', meaning either 1976 or 196x. My guess was a 68 or 69?
<br>
in 2024 I found images of old eaton's catelogues on FB, and tehre it was. The 1966 glider came in ruby red, had my distinctive diamond chainring (no swans, hands or Raleigh types) and crucially advirtises the 3-speed grip shift. That's the one! At $49.95, it was clearly a good deal. Would love to get or make a replicate of the behind-the-seat touring bag. It's smart - holds your lunch and or beach shoes, without taking a pannier spot or adding much weight too far back.
