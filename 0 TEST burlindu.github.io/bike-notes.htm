<b>NOTES</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RALEIGH-MADE 3 SPEED  
<br>
1967-8ish?
<br>
I had thought was maybe a 69 but images online of Eaton's catelogue has Gliders in 67 and 68 listed as having the uncommon grip shift - that could be it. Could also be earlier.

<br><br>
<b>DROPOUTS</b>
<br>
REAR DROPOUTS HAVE RACK MOUNT BEHIND WHEEL MOUNT, NOT ABOVE, SUGGESTING ACTUAL RALEIGH MANUFACTURE (PER THE GREAT SHELDON BROWN)

<br><br>
<b>SEAT</b>
<br>
"Selle" is Italian for "saddles." 
<br>
It is the plural of "sella," saddle (SB)


<br><br>
<b>SEAT POST</b>
<br>
SHELDON BROWN SAYS OLD STEEL BIKES MEASURE TUBE DIAMETER ON THE OUTSIDE
TYPICAL 1 1/8" (28.6) SEAT TUBE. (SO WHEN TUBES GOT THINNER SEATPOSTS GOT THICKER....)
<br>
ALL RALEIGH 3-SPEEDS ARE 1" 25.4mm SEAT POSTS

<br><br>
<b>FRONT WHEEL HUB</b>
<br>
<b>**** CHECK THIS RUINS HUB IF INSTALLED WRONG ****</b>
<br>
--- Also Measure the Hub and Fork spacing - I have no record ---
<br>
Should be 91mm I think - SB says 91 for Nottingham Raleighs.
<br>
Hub width is same as fork - where Hub is in contact with fork inside
<br>
CHECK FRONT WHEEL - SB SAYS THE RALEIGH 3-SPEED FRONT HUB IS DIRECTIONAL & CAN BE INSTALLED BACKWARDS ON THE FORK - CHECK THIS!! (see quote below)
<br>
Modern Disc brakes pull hubs out of the fork, so now through-axels are used.
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
The forks used on most Nottingham Raleighs have keyhole-shaped axle slots. These are designed to fit Raleigh hubs, with thin (5/16") solid axles and wheel retention shoulders on the cones. The spacing between the inner faces of the fork ends is less than the modern 100 mm standard. If you wish to mount a modern hub on a Nottingham Raleigh, be prepared to do some filing on the fork ends, to enlarge the lower part of the slots to fit the modern axle. Use a good sharp file, and, if possible, have the fork end itself clamped into a sturdy vise. If you don't, vibration of the fork will make it difficult to file. Make sure you file both sides the same amount, so the axle will not go in crooked.

Most front wheels can be installed without regard for which side is left and which side is right. This is not the case with Raleigh 3-speeds. Raleigh front hubs usually don't have cone locknuts. Instead, they have one cone with wrench flats, the adjustable cone. The other cone is round, with no place for a wrench. The non-adjustable cone is supposed to screw down all the way on the axle until it runs out of threads (there is a raised shoulder on the axle for this purpose). All adjustments are to be made with the adjustable cone. The fixed cone must go on the bicycle's right, the adjustable cone must go on the bicycle's left. On the left side, the axle nut will keep the left cone from loosening up. If the wheel is accidentally reversed, so that the adjustable cone is on the right, it can tighten itself up and ruin the hub.

<b>BSD</b>
<br>
TIRES USE SHRADER TUBES 26 x 1 3/8". 
<br>
1 3/8 is 34.9mm (rim width)
<br>
ISO/ETRTO ARE STD TIRES/WHEEL SIZING. ISO IS THE BEAD SEAT DIAMETER - NOT THE VISIBLE RIM. IT IS THE SMALLEST DIAMETER OF THE TIRE INSIDE THE RIM. **RIM DIAMETER IS TYPICAL 10MM GREATER THAN BSD.
<br>
26 x 1 3/8" E.A.3 is ISO/ETRTO 590mm BSD. FRENCH EQUIV(?) IS 650A TYPE. A 700C WHEEL IS 622mm.

<b>BB</b>
<br>
BOTTOM BRACKET IS LIKELY: Raleigh,  1 3/8" X 26 tpi,  CUPS R-L,  (34.9 x ? mm)
HANDLEBARS: OLD ENGLISH 3-SPEED SIZE, CLAMP IS 15/16ths, 23.8mm
<br>
GRIP AREA IS 22.2" or 7/8". NEW BARS ARE LIKELY 25.4mm AT THE CLAMP - TOO BIG!!
HEADSET: 1" RALEIGH TYPE. STEM IS 22.2mm 7/8", STEERER OUTER DIAMETER 25.4", FRAME CUP 30mm OUTSIDE.

Raleigh, Rudge & Humber
<br>
These were the flagship brands of Raleigh Industries, and are of equal quality. 26" wheel models would normally come with Raleigh-pattern rims and Brooks leather saddles. Having separate lines allowed Raleigh to offer exclusive territories to local dealers without writing off other dealers in the same area. The frames on these bikes were generally identical, but each had special distinctive cosmetic features, particularly in the fork construction, and the pattern of the cutouts in the chainwheel

The Heron Raleigh chainrings (3 Herons) faced right until 1977, when they weere switched left to match teh direction of teh Raleigh badging.
