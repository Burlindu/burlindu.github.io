CAMERAS<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>


Original 35mm fixed lens VIVITAR
<br>
38mm lens, took to Epsom, brilliant
<br>
That thing was awesome
<br><br>
PENTAX from Dad
<br>
I don't know what model - decent with some manual controls (a proper 35mm film camera) but not a great light meter like the Canons had. With stock 18-55 kit zoom
<br><br>
PENTAX SUPER PROGRAM
<br>
30th birthday gift from mom
<br>
From Henry's, Used, with fantastic 50mm prime (1.2?)
<br>
Took to Europe 2001
<br><br>
FUJI digial P-A-s
<br>
sort of crummy but did what needed - but the Vivitar was waaay better
<br><br>
(Somewhere in here I got a little cannon digital PAS as well; it was very serviceable as a pocket camera)
<br><br>
Pentax K100d
<br>
Good DSLR - with 18-55 kit, upgraded to 50mm 1.4 (FF lens) (xmas gift from LN)
<br>
Internal motor, colours a bit flat, AA betteries
<br>
Had tested a Nikon D40 - should have kept that but had no motor-in-lens primes avail at time of purchase
<br><br>
SONY NEX-5 with 16mm pancake
<br>
Wanted a mirrorless APSC with flip-out screen in line with the lens
<br>
Bought after discontinued on sale - a bargain at the 24mm (equiv) FOV that I love
<br>
Odd colour, Sony not yet a big-time player - but took so many great pics with this camera - the not perfect colour and lens corner distortions well bade up for by great form factor and fun ease-of-use
<br><br>
The Phones:
<br>
LG keyboard phone - pics like 640x480 or something like that!
<br>
NEXUS 5 - basic but good after software update
<br>
Samsung A6 (2017) - great value but no OS cripples Camera
<br>
Pixel 3a - wow the power of modern software
<br>
Pixel 6 - wider angle, like my ideal 16/24mm. So sharp and bright, unreal pics for a not-a-real-Camera

EXTRA NOTES ON FILM & digital<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>


<b>Film is the best, and digital is the best Too</b>
<br><br>
The Vivitar light box was an amazing zoom-with-your-feet camera - no ficusing, and full 35mm film glory.
<br>
<br>
The Pentax Super Program was more than a camera, it was a friend. Learning how to guess ditances so you could focus without looking through the viewfinder was awesome.
<br>
<br>
The Pixel means you don't have to post-process colour. The software ajustments are just unreal. If you can get your favorite FOV you can just treat it like a magic prime, like in the old days
<br>
<br>
FINALLY - using the 3a to photograph my old Super-Program slides, projected on a white wall, makes for an amazing digital-film hybrid. Pixel software magic combined with film slide 35mm magic.
<br>
<br>
<b>
**** PS CLEANING ALL THE DIRT OFF THESE SLIDES WAS JUST TOO MUCH WORK. THE FILM IS REAL FILM CRUD (or we might say, the 'tasty bits')
</b>
<br>
<br>
Pics below are Europe backpack trip 2001.
<br>
These are the wall-projected slides photograpghd by the Pixel 3a.
<br>
My nephew asked - what filter is that? Because they look soft of warm magical. However there is no filter. The fact that they are all taken with a quite fast 50mm also helps I'm sure - the infinitely gradual dropoff of real lens depth-of-field can't be matched. Also, softness of film/manual photography adds a sort of lovely dream quality; I love these pics - as slides I liked them by they sat in a box; as digital scans they are suddenly all I would have hoped in the beginning.

The SUPER PROGRAM<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>

I got the Super Program, used from Henry's, in 2001.<br>
It looks like the original was 1983. I somehow thought I had the 50 1.2 lens - the very vintage super fast one - or maybe the 1.4, which seems to be more in circulation. However my hand drawn pic of my camera shows an apature ring of 1.7-22. 
<br> 
In any case, it was a really lovely lens to use. The mechanisms and markings and feel were a real pleasure. One of the issues I had when I moved to DSLR digital was the change to not having the apature ring on the lens. Now the Super Program is not ideal by any means - there's no shutter speed or PASM dial! - but it still just felt great. Maybe that meant more fucus on apature? Anyway, control was good, and fun. Buttons for shutter speed control (as the Super Program has/had) just seems dumb and bad, but it still worked fine either in the view finder or just looking from above, as I often did (sometimes I judged distance by eye, and set the lens focal distance without the split ring in the view finder, crazy as that seems. It really did make it feel like an art form.

Phones<br>
---------------------<br>
<br>

The Nexus 5 had a decent camera, and mechanical OS, which means a lot.<br>
The Samsung A5 camera was OK, but Samsung over-saturates and without optical stabilization the percentage of shots that are actually good is small - handheld shots are almost always 2nd-rate. So not a real camera.<br>
<br><br>
The Pixels changed everything.
<br>
The colour processing is amazing and overall the image quality is just absurdly high. It's odd. My ideal (favoured) FOV is as per a 24mm ff lens (16mm on an APSC). That's 74°. A 50mm ff is 40°, a 35 prime ff is 54°. The pixel 3a was 65°, so 1/2 way beteen a normal 50mma nd a wide 24mm. SO the Pixel 3a was good for me, but still a compromise from a real camera. However the Pixel 6 came in at an astounding 72° - just 2° off a 24mm. Wow. They too, when making a totally mainstream camera, recognize the magical quality of wide shots. It's amazing. The Pixel 10, which I have not used, is listed as FOV 82° ! Wow, maybe too wide? That is amazing. With the right software you could have a set switch (instead of just 'zoom', like on a kit lens) for a set of primes - a 35, a 50, a 24, and a 20.5 (82° FOV). That is amazing. And appearently the lens they use in the pixel cameras is itself not that great - it certainly is small - it's the software magic (and I think repreated exposures in some cases from which they can build a file. I think the moment between the file take/save - as a RAW file - and the 'presentation' of a JPG has fantastic value,a nd explains why teh camera phones can do so much even up against real cameras and lenses of a previous generation.
