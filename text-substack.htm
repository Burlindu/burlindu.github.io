Adding direct links as Substack Main feed may not be good
<br>

Founder posted an evil bit about how the twitter files were censorship, how Facebook's droping fact checking was good, and saying that X was now better than it was as a space for free speach. So substack may be doomed
<br>
<br>
It's amazing how dumb these arguements are and how they typically are collected together. 
<br>
<br>
As a simple point-by-point, the Twitter files we (as far as I could tell) a basic exchange of communication between a governemnt that was concerned a mostly unregulated media platform was being used by questionable actors to try and destabalize Amwerican elections, and the media platform more or less aggreeing and taking some measures to vet posting (in part, no doubt, being concerned that their platform type would ebcome a target for regulation if it did indeed become a favorite home fo rpeople wanting to publish election misinformattion). 
<br>
<br>
Facebook having or not having fact checking seems absurd in itslef, seeing as it's such a lightweight platform taht seems deciacted to a mass digital junk mail platform. The idea removing the hilariously small amount of fwact checking it has being a good thing is hilarious. 'I'd like to take a highly, highly unreliable platform and make remove any guardrails taht might keep some semblance of reliability at teh far fringes'. Ha ha ha, it's both a stupid goal AND pointless.
<br>
<br>
Finally that X is now better for free speach - my goodness the idea of what free specah is is entirely lost on these people. So pretentious, contually claiming to herald a concept which, although quite simple, is clearly well over their heads. Obviously in a free speach environment platforms would be free to determine for themselves which typoe of speach to publisha nd not publish. The only restriction on free speach would be if a governemnt demanded by law and increase of decrease in moderation. For example, free speach is limited when iot cwould come to the distribution of illegal content (classificed state documents, illegal pornogrphy, illegal invasion of privacy). A platform tat moderates for dog video content rather than car video content is no more 'anti-free speech' than is a platform taht favours democratic content over republican content or favours nice, fairly reliable news reporting over rude, agrressive clearly politically motivated fake news. 
<br>
<br>
The National Enquirer is an expression of Free Speach in the same way that the New York Times is. The counter arguement would be that the National Enquirer is a superior expression of free speech because it will publish clearly false information about bigfoot. And the NYT would be anti-free speach because it publishes 3 articles from nobel prize winning economists saying Trump Tariff wars are dumb and also refused to publish one article by a Hotel marketer who works for Trump Hotels that says the tariffs are a work of genius. In this hilariously stupid point of view 'freedome of speech' consists of publishers not reading or vetting what they publish (since it's digital, ha ha). And of course, we all know, it has nothing to do with free speach. It's just a person who likes dumba dn false artyicles and is mad beacuse the platforms that get the most widespread respect vet out dumb and false content. So their solutipon, hilarious again, is to try and lobbythat the vetting of content is 'anti-free speach'. And since Free Speech is enshrined in law, the idea is to try and restrict content vetting by law (of free speech). Of course having the government/law restrict content moderation of speech which itself is not illegal (poltical opnions not being illegal) is itself, hilariously again, a direct call for for a restriuction of free speech in teh name of a fae, stupid and just plain wrong idea of free speech'. It's all just so stupid it's dumbfounding. Are these people relaly this dumb? And the answer is, reading what they say on the topic, is yes they are. Oh yes, ha ha ha, tehy totally are. It's like tahyt dumb kid in high school who tried to but into teh conversation of regualr kids with a stupid and obiuosly wrong bombastic statemnt and immediately becae a social parriah becuase they would not be quiet and go away. They just couldn;t shut up abiout it, pushing their clearly stupid and wrong statement. Way to go, substack dude.
<br>
<br>
I think there is a bit of an indicator here of what is going on. The antagonist here (in this case the Substack founder-type) hates moderate, accurate speecha dn protes false, made-up speech. This evolves to a call for a higher legal athority (the Supreme Court, which might oversay cases involving Free Speech) to try and restrict, moderate, intelligent speech. In other words, they do not see intelligent, moderate speech as occuring out of choice - they see it as resulting onluy under compusion. It can't be taht Facebook wanted to publish accurate election information - it must be taht only through giovernment interfenece did it restrict the propogatipon of false information. So it's not just "I like stupid, fake talk" but one step up to 'I am correct in this and it is the correct human nature to like stupid false speech. Therefore' - and here's your clincher 'other people must also, in their true hearts, want fake stupid speech. And so therefore the accurate publications of the New York Times (and the like) is not the result of them preferring and chioosing moderate, accurate speech - it must be occurring under compulsion!'. Oh my goodness it's so aweful that it must be kind of funny. It's just simple weakness of character. It's 'I like stupid and dumb speech, and I liek it so much that I can't believe that othr peope actually prefere by choice modeate and accurate speech. Therefore - someone must be forcing them to talk this way. I'm saving them! (with my substack publisher's op-ed)'. I'll save them by getting rid of moderation!
<br>
\<br>
Now do these people actually believe that people  are producing acurrate speech under compulsion (ie moderation) rather than by choice? Of course not. They don't believe it for a moment. However they also don't care if their own speech is accyrate - taht was the original point. If you are arguing not just in favour of dumb, innacurate speech but for a mandate for dumb inaccurate speech than of course you are going to use dumb inaccurate speech to make that arguement. One of teh errors that clever people often make is they expect the person lobbying for a very stupid arguement will make some kind of sound case for teh stupidly. Of course not. The analysis will be made taht 'I think the strategy they are using is...' which is often just the relatively clever person despiratly trying to invent a somewhat reasonable arguement in favour of a stupid podition because they refuse to admit that teh stupid position is being taken because the antagonist just really does like dumb stupid arguements. And sadly, Mr. Substack, they truely, really do.
