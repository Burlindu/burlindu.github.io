Layout 2 is just if I'm making big test changes to css

Take the page that is being tested
make a copy of LAYOUT called LAYOUT2
redirect the HTL page to use LAYOUT2 instead of LAYOUT for CSS
Make the test

If it works good, you can replace LAYOUT with the new LAYOUT2 code
and make the HTML go back to getting CSS from LAYOUT
