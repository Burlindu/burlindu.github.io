<b>BURLSITES</b>
<br>
<br>
Way back in the day I bought an IBM desktop computer with an early AMD processor - like an AM386 (1992?) (AMD 386DX-40? A more itilitarian ver of the APTIVE Stealth - those were classic black IBM desktops - or a NetVista) or maybe it was a K6. It was definitely pre-Athlon, pre 64-bit. Old-school. Almost all PC's were aweful beige, or at best light grey. The IBM - tower (a horiontal desktop model, nice), keyboard and monitor - were all black. Ya, baby. I'm guessing the monitor was a 14", a CRT of course, maybe 15" at best.
<br> 
<br>
I also got the proper IBM brand powerbar with an ethernet pass-through. Doing it right. The computer, monitor and keyboard are all gone - the power bar is still maybe my best one.
<br> 
<br>
Anyway, so the venture into the internet began.
<br>
<br>
<b>V0 is burlcrone.com</b> (or web_homepage), useless fun page
<br>
Originally it had no links, was just visual & audio fun
<br>
(later added Samurai Jack page with text links)
<br>
<br>
<b>V1 is SURF 1</b> - the first genration 'use' as landing page
<br>
Originally one background (surfing) image with simple text links
<br>
which evolved into formatted box & categories of links
<br>
<br>
<b>V2 is SURF II</b> - graphical interface, mutiple pages
<br>
More categories, so nested pages
<br>
The surfer image replaced with Trianglify - the idea is we have entered the 'abstract' world of pure internet
<br>
<br>
<b>V3 is SURF III</b>
<br>
Now! The surfer from 2007 is back 
<br>
It's SURF II with a warmer, 2024 feel
<br>
Revamp brought on by the surprise loss of the free UofT server space
<br>(i.e. neglected project sees return of the love)
