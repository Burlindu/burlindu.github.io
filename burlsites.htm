<b>BURLSITES</b>
<br>
<br>
Way back in the day I bought an IBM desktop computer with an early AMD processor - like an AM386 (1992) (AMD 386DX-40?maybe an APTIVE Stealth - those were classic black IBM desktops - or a NetVista) or maybe it was a K6. It was definitely pre-Atalon, pre 64-bit. Old-school. Almost all PC's were aweful beige, or at best light grey. The IBM - tower (a horiontal desktop model, nice), keyboard and monitor - were all black. Ya, baby.
<br> 
<br>
I also got the proper IBM brand powerbar with an ethernet pass-through. Doing it right. The computer, monitor and keyboard are all gone - the power bar is still maybe my best one.

<br>
<b>ORIGINAL burlcrone.com:</b>
<br>
<br>
Lost when I dropped the PC on the kitchen floor and the HD instantly died. No backup, no external host. Goodbye
<br>
burlcrone.com started basically as a series of pictures of me platying electric guitar, wearing a bathrpobe, photoshopped into great rock album covers. If you clicked on the album cover an audio clip from teh album would play.
<br>
<br>
<b>
The albums were: Van Halen 1 (of course), Exist Stage Left, and I can't recall the other 2.
</b>
<br>
I think I added images of paintings and pictures after that, so it might have passed for an 'artist's personal webpage'.
<br>
<br>
At some point the landing page was me photoshopped onto an image of Samurai Jack jumping through the air to attack AKU with his sword, over giant flames.
<br>
The background here! Somehow, that image remains
<br>
(It was overlaid with text links in the site)
