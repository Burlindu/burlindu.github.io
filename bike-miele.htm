Champagne Miele (1986 Astro 6?)
<hr>
<br>
I wanted a city bike like old Chinese men ride in China. 
<br>
I had the Peugot 10-speed, whioch I used while at Knox, but it was too narrow and fragile for a proper city bike. I wanted a true city bike
<br>
<br>
One day at lunch at UofT (OSM) I went to get a hot dog in front of Robart's Library and an old chinese man was standing by a bike with a for sale sign. It might have been.... $40? It was cheap. I had only my hot dog money. He spoke no english.
<br>
I indicated I would buy the next day. I pointed at the sun. Indicated it going down below horizon,a nd then up to same place it was in that day. One day, 24 hours. He nodded he understood. I went back to work and I think he went home. The next day we met in the same place at the same time and I purchased teh bike.
<br>
<br>
I thik it was a 1986 Miele Astro 6.
The serial # (I refistered it wioth TO police) was BS611557, and Bike Forums T-Mar says the 6 is a year end date. The 1986 Miele Catelogue has an ASTRO 6 that looks right and lists a Gun Grey as a colour option. BUT - the Astro 6 has only 6 gears, only a rear derailler, and teh cranks are wrong. All else looks corrrect. Mine might be a 1986 ASTRO 6 with Sugino cranks added, and 3 front gears. I got rid of any front deraillier and replaced the big ring with a solid billet disk (pant guard) from Urbane cycling - unwittingly making tegh bike more like it was originally.
<br>
<br>
I replaced teh grips wiith leather, git better (great) cast city pedals, got the nice San Marco seat from Bateman's (when he was still working from a garage on Baldwin) and city continental tires. And - my trademark then - dual metal bar/wire collapsing pannier boxes. It was pretty sweet - both fast and hardy for city use.
<br>
<br>
One day I realized it was not in its spot in the 1407 apartment. I had taken it downtown the day before, had stipped to run an errand close by on Yonge, and had walked home, forgetting I had bloody ridden my bike. I went and looked for it, riding teh old Peugot to various Yonge St area bike rings looking for the Miele. Itw as never seena again.
