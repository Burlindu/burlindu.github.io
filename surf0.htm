<b>ORIGINAL burlcrone.com</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>The original website is gone</b>
<br>
(i.e. not only the live site, but all the code & images as well)
<br>
<br>
It started on my old black IBM sysem - before the age of pentium. I think it was locally hosted. The original site was images and my seeing what I could do with a bit of coding and the internet. It was fun
<br>
<br>
I dropped that desktop-PC case on the kitechen floor (I can't recall why I was moving it around the house) and the HD died instantly - and thre was no backup and no cloud servies. So I lost 100% of everything I had on any computer anywhere. Ahhh, the early 2000's......
<br>
<br>
I remember going to Europe with a backpack, around 2000 - it was the timeframe of internet cafes, because nobody had internet on a phone yet (first iphone was 2007).
<br>
I went to Montpellier, which is a University town and so had fibre-optic hookups - and there was an art gallery church that had a lineup of free terminals. And I could lookup burlcrone.com from all the way away in France. I showed it to Rosealba, the girl I had met, and she said 'are you an artist?'. I did not know how to answer that question, so I shrugged and said yes, I guess so. It was horsing around with some undefined aim in mind. The early internet had so little established fom taht it resembled some unknown typr of avant-garge artistic expression
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It is too bad I don't have a copy of 2000 burlcrone.com. In partulcar I no longer have the picture of me wearing a bathrobe playing electric guitar which I photoshopped into various album covers (Van Halen I, Exist Stage Left, and forgotten others) and added audio clips to. It had no point, and that was the point. It was internet for internet's sake; the now gone golden age of early internet. Goodbye, site version 0.0!
<br>
<br>
BUT I do have one remaining image - the original burlcrone.com did become my landing/launch page for finding stuuff on the internet, and the image shown here of me as Samurai Jack, was the background for the opening links page. Somehow, this one image - this is the original image - survived. That's why this background is 1000 x 680 pixels. Because, early 2000's.
