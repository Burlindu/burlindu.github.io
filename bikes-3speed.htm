<b>(A) INTRO: What?</></b>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

I have an Eaton's bRand Glider - <br>a re-branded <b>Raleigh Sports</b> from I estimate 1969-ish, with an AW 3-speed hub and rare spec original grip shift. It's small - seat tube 19 1/2". The Logos are Doves (not Raleigh Swans) and the chainring is pointed triangles facing each other (not swans or other). The Rear-hub cable feed is a plastic wheel, clamp-on, and the cranks are short with a cotter. One crank is missing a nut on the cotter bolt (!) but the nut seems rusted or bent in place so just stays as is. This means that assembly has not been taken apart and remains unserviced. The original steel rear rim split so I had a new wheel built - a SUNRIM CR18 aluminum rim built around the original gear hub (by Urbane Cyclist in 2017). So it remains a 590 ETRO wheel. The paint is a beautiful dark red with gold foil bands on the seat tube (per this vintage Raleigh's) and awesome GLIDER text and head-tube badge.

<br>
<br>
The <b>Roadster</b> was a heavy & higher-end 'country' bike with bigger wheels, slacker angles, longer wheelbase and fully-covered chains. The <b>Sports</b> is like mine. The <b>Club</b> was those over-stylized race sytle (uncomfortable) bike with drop bars and better tubing.
<br>
<br>
" 
<br>
<b>Sports</b> or "light roadster" bicycles were the basic transportation of the urban working class. They feature 590 mm (26 x 1 3/8) wheels with Endrick or Raleigh-pattern rims, full steel fenders (or "mudguards" to the British) "North Road" upright handlebars, and cable-operated brakes. Sports bicycles had rather more nimble frame geometry, typically with 72 degree frame angles. These bicycles were faster and lighter than roadsters. The vast majority of English bicycles that made it to the United States fall into this category.

<br>
<b>Identification</b><br>
Before you start to work on an English 3-speed (or a low-end English 10-speed), you should figure out who made it. By 1962, Raleigh or its parent company, Tube Investments (TI bought Raleigh in 1960) had gobbled up most of the smaller English manufacturers. In its enormous Nottingham factory, Raleigh built bikes under many names. It is important to know whether a bike was built by Raleigh because the <b>Raleigh bikes were built to Raleigh dimensions, and other English bikes were built to British Standard dimensions.</b>
<br><br>
Humber 1932, BSA - New Hudson - Sunbeam 1957,
Rudge-Whitworth 1943, Phillips 1960,
Triumph 1954, Hercules 1960,
Norman 1960, Sun 1960,
Three Spires 1954, Carlton 1960,
Moulton 1967
<br><br>
The major areas of concern are headsets and bottom brackets. <b>Non-Raleigh British bikes use B.S.C. parts, which are readily available. Raleigh used its own unique 26 threads-per-inch parts, which are not interchangeable with anything else.</b> This is particularly a problem if you need to replace a fork on a Raleigh-built bike, because you will also have to replace the headset if you cannot locate a 26 TPI fork. Fortunately, the press-fit dimensions on the head tube of the frame are the same for both.
<br>

<br>

<br>
<b>How to tell the Raleighs from the others</b><br>
The easiest way to identify Raleigh-built bikes is by looking at the rear dropouts. Almost all Raleigh-threaded bikes have the rear fender eyelets located directly behind the axle, instead of above it. (This doesn't apply to roadsters, which don't generally have dropouts nor fender eyelets.)
<br>
Most Raleighs use a seatpost diameter of 1" (25.4 mm) while other British 3-speed bikes usually use 1 1/16" (27.0 mm)

<b>NOTES ON RALEIGH THREADING & SIZING</b>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/raleigh26.html" class="button4">SB info on RALEIGH THREADING</a>
<br>
<br>
BSC was an early 'British Standard Cycle' for dimensions etc - this later became ISO!
<br>
But... Raleigh was the "Microsoft of the bicycling industry" (SB) and choose not to use the BSC. 
<br>
"Since Raleigh made virtually every part of these bikes, there was no compelling need to match standards used by other manufacturers." (DB)
<br>
<b>
"The main difference is that B.S.C./ISO screw threads for the bottom bracket and fork steerer/headset have a pitch of 24 threads per inch (TPI), while the corresponding Raleigh parts have a slightly finer 26 TPI threading." (SB)
</b>
<br>
"Most Raleighs use a seatpost diameter of 1" (25.4 mm) while other British 3-speed bikes usually use 1 1/16" (27.0 mm)" (SB)
<br>
"The width of the bottom bracket shell is also an indication. Standard British (24 TPI) bottom bracket shells are 68 mm wide, give or take a mm. Raleigh 26 TPI shells are generally 71 mm or 76 mm wide."
<br>
<br>
"<br>
<b>Generally speaking, Raleighs that use cottered cranks have Raleigh 26 TPI threading for both the bottom bracket and the headset.</b> 
<br>.... Although the diameters are the same as B.S.C., the different thread pitch makes the parts incompatible. This article will provide strategies for getting around this problem.
<br>"(SB)



<br>
<br>
<b>CRANKS</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
If you are not satisfied with cottered cranks, and want to upgrade a Nottingham Raleigh frame to cotterless cranks, you will have to re-use the old cups unless you are prepared to spring for a Phil Wood bottom bracket, or a Velo Orange threadless bottom bracket -- see article on cartridge bottom brackets. The inner diameter of Raleigh cups is a bit smaller than standard. Many bottom-bracket axles will not fit unless you replace the standard 1/4" bearing balls with 15/64" or 6 mm bearing balls. Because of the wider BB shells used on Raleighs, you will need a J.I.S. 5 or 7 series axle.
<br>
" (SB)


<br>
<br>
<b>HUBS</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
Most front wheels can be installed without regard for which side is left and which side is right. This is not the case with Raleigh 3-speeds. Raleigh front hubs usually don't have cone locknuts. Instead, they have one cone with wrench flats, the adjustable cone. The other cone is round, with no place for a wrench. The non-adjustable cone is supposed to screw down all the way on the axle until it runs out of threads (there is a raised shoulder on the axle for this purpose). All adjustments are to be made with the adjustable cone. The fixed cone must go on the bicycle's right, the adjustable cone must go on the bicycle's left. On the left side, the axle nut will keep the left cone from loosening up. If the wheel is accidentally reversed, so that the adjustable cone is on the right, it can tighten itself up and ruin the hub.
<br>
" (SB)

<br>
<br>
"
<br>
Raleighs also used an unusual wheel retention feature. The axle slot in the front fork end is keyhole shaped. Older hubs came with special axle nuts and washers. The axle nut had a shoulder which fitted through the axle washer and into the round part of the axle slot. Later hubs have a shoulder on the cone which fits into the round part of the axle slot, and it is necessary to spread the fork blades a bit to get the wheel in or out. This is the more common arrangement.
<br>
" (SB)


<br>
<br>
<b>REAR DROPOUTS & HUB</b>
<br>
<br>
Most Nottingham Raleigh rear dropouts have narrow (8 mm) slots intended for the flat-sided axles common on Sturmey-Archer and other older British hubs. This still works with modern Sturmey-Archer and SRAM internal-gear hubs which have flatted axles. Most other modern rear hubs are 10 mm, some are even 10.5 mm, so you will need to file the rear as well. Shimano internal-gear hub axles are flatted, but the anti-rotation washers place the flats at an angle to the dropout slots. We recommend doing all of the filing on the bottom of the slot. This eliminates the risk of making one side higher than the other.
<br><br>
<b>Dropout spacing on bikes made for 3-speed applications is typically 114 mm (4 1/2 inches)</b>. 5-speed derailer systems usually used 120 mm. Many upgrades will call for a wider dropout spacing.
<br>
"(SB)


<br>
<br>
<b>FORK ENDS & DROPOUTS</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
<b>The forks used on most Nottingham Raleighs have keyhole-shaped axle slots. These are designed to fit Raleigh hubs, with thin (5/16") solid axles and wheel retention shoulders on the cones. The spacing between the inner faces of the fork ends is less than the modern 100 mm standard.</b> If you wish to mount a modern hub on a Nottingham Raleigh, be prepared to do some filing on the fork ends, to enlarge the lower part of the slots to fit the modern axle. Use a good sharp file, and, if possible, have the fork end itself clamped into a sturdy vise. If you don't, vibration of the fork will make it difficult to file. Make sure you file both sides the same amount, so the axle will not go in crooked.
<br><br>
The fork blades should be spread to match the over-locknut dimension of the hub. The dropouts will need to be realigned as well, to avoid bending the hub axle after the blades have been spread. The fork rake of Raleigh three-speeds is rather large, and so trail is less than optimal, and unbending the fork blades a bit can improve handling. I hesitate to advise realigning a fork unless you have access to a proper jig. You could just replace the fork instead.
<br>
"(SB)

<br>
<br>
<b>HEADSET</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
<b>As with the bottom brackets, Raleigh differs from B.S.C./ISO in using 26 threads per inch instead of 24.</b> Fortunately, all of the other mounting dimensions are the same between the two systems.
<br><br>--- &nbsp
The adjustable race is octagonal, 1 5/8" (41.3 mm) across the flats..
<br><br>--- &nbsp
The top nut is also octagonal, and may measure 1 3/16" (30.16mm), 1 7/32" (31.0mm), 1 1/4" (31.75mm) or 1 11/32" (34.13mm) across the flats: all four of these measurements have been recorded. Headset top nuts are one important reason to own a 12 inch or larger adjustable wrench for shop work on bicycles.
<br><br>--- &nbsp
The headset uses 25 5/32 inch loose bearing balls in each race.
<br><br>--- &nbsp
All four races have U-shaped channels for the bearing balls. These make it easier to install bearing balls without losing any, and allow some small forward-rearward movement of the fork tips even when the headset is correctly adjusted
<br>
<br>
..... To use ISO headset parts, you would have to mill the head tube and fork crown: dimensions are 30.2 and 26.4mm.
<br>
"(SB)


<br>
<br>
<b>Brake Reach</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
The typical Raleigh-built 3-speed comes with 590 mm (26 x 1 3/8) rims, with long-reach brakes, around 75 mm at the front and 80 mm at the rear
<br>
"(SB)

<br>
<br>
<b>Handlebar / Stem</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
As mentioned above, Raleigh forks are completely standard except for the thread pitch. Thus, any standard stem with a 7/8" (22.2 mm) quill will fit into the forks.
<br>
There is an issue, however, at the top end of the stem. This is not a Raleigh-specific issue, but applies to older British bikes from all makers. The handlebar clamp diameters on older British bicycles depended on the material of the handlebars, rather than what type of bars they were. Specifically, steel handlebars (and the stems made for them) used a 15/16" (23.8 mm) clamping diameter at the middle of the bar. Most Nottingham Raleighs have this type of bar/stem.
<br>
Thus, if you wish to replace the stem and keep the handlebar, the hole in the new stem will be too large to clamp properly. You can get around this by using a shim to make up the difference, though this is a bit inelegant.
<br>
If you want to replace the handlebar, you should really replace the stem too, because it is unsafe to overspread the 15/16" stem to fit a standard 1" (25.4 mm) handlebar.
<br>
"(SB)


<br>
<br>
<b>FENDERS & MOUNTS</b>
<br>
<br>
"
<br>
The eyelets in the fork ends, where the fender/mudguard stays attach to the frame, also use a non-standard, Raleigh-specific threading. It is common to tap these out to the standard 5 x 0.8 metric size.

<b>(C) CONCLUSION</b>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

"
<br>
<b>These Are Real Bikes!</b><br>
Don't sneer at old 3-speeds. They are serious bikes, built for serious use. They are meant for utilitarian cyclists, and they are still extremely appropriate for riders who don't usually go more than a few miles at a time. They are particularly at home in stop-and-go traffic, because they can be shifted even while stopped. Their English heritage: full fenders, oil lubrication, and totally enclosed gear system, makes them relatively impervious to wet conditions. They may be heavy. That is not because they were built to be cheap, but because they were built to endure extremely rough usage and neglect. Properly cared for, they will outlast us all.

This picture (from SB's website) is from the 1969 Raleigh catelogue. It looks about right.
<br>
The gold foil banding on the seat tube is like mine and the cranks are similar - triangles, not swans. 
<br>
I paid $250 in 2012 (used). This page shows 67.95, which I assume is dollars but may be pounds. So clearly they have increased in value. 
<br>
$68 in 1969 is rated as say $425 in 2012 - so I paid a little more than 1/2 price for a used bike in V good condition, that sounds about right.
