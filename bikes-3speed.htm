The <b>Roadster</b> was a heavy & higher-end 'country' bike with bigger wheels, slacker angles, longer wheelbase and fully-covered chains. The <b>Sports</b> is like mine. The <b>Club</b> was those over-stylized race sytle (uncomfortable) bike with drop bars and better tubing.

<b>Sports</b> or "light roadster" bicycles were the basic transportation of the urban working class. They feature 590 mm (26 x 1 3/8) wheels with Endrick or Raleigh-pattern rims, full steel fenders (or "mudguards" to the British) "North Road" upright handlebars, and cable-operated brakes. Sports bicycles had rather more nimble frame geometry, typically with 72 degree frame angles. These bicycles were faster and lighter than roadsters. The vast majority of English bicycles that made it to the United States fall into this category.

<b>Identification</b><br>
Before you start to work on an English 3-speed (or a low-end English 10-speed), you should figure out who made it. By 1962, Raleigh or its parent company, Tube Investments (TI bought Raleigh in 1960) had gobbled up most of the smaller English manufacturers. In its enormous Nottingham factory, Raleigh built bikes under many names. It is important to know whether a bike was built by Raleigh because the <b>Raleigh bikes were built to Raleigh dimensions, and other English bikes were built to British Standard dimensions.</b>

The major areas of concern are headsets and bottom brackets. <b>Non-Raleigh British bikes use B.S.C. parts, which are readily available. Raleigh used its own unique 26 threads-per-inch parts, which are not interchangeable with anything else.</b> This is particularly a problem if you need to replace a fork on a Raleigh-built bike, because you will also have to replace the headset if you cannot locate a 26 TPI fork. Fortunately, the press-fit dimensions on the head tube of the frame are the same for both.

<b>How to tell the Raleighs from the others</b><br>
The easiest way to identify Raleigh-built bikes is by looking at the rear dropouts. Almost all Raleigh-threaded bikes have the rear fender eyelets located directly behind the axle, instead of above it. (This doesn't apply to roadsters, which don't generally have dropouts nor fender eyelets.)
<br>
Most Raleighs use a seatpost diameter of 1" (25.4 mm) while other British 3-speed bikes usually use 1 1/16" (27.0 mm)

<b>CRANKS</b>
<br>
"
<br>
If you are not satisfied with cottered cranks, and want to upgrade a Nottingham Raleigh frame to cotterless cranks, you will have to re-use the old cups unless you are prepared to spring for a Phil Wood bottom bracket, or a Velo Orange threadless bottom bracket -- see article on cartridge bottom brackets. The inner diameter of Raleigh cups is a bit smaller than standard. Many bottom-bracket axles will not fit unless you replace the standard 1/4" bearing balls with 15/64" or 6 mm bearing balls. Because of the wider BB shells used on Raleighs, you will need a J.I.S. 5 or 7 series axle.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>HUBS</b>
<br>
"
<br>
Most front wheels can be installed without regard for which side is left and which side is right. This is not the case with Raleigh 3-speeds. Raleigh front hubs usually don't have cone locknuts. Instead, they have one cone with wrench flats, the adjustable cone. The other cone is round, with no place for a wrench. The non-adjustable cone is supposed to screw down all the way on the axle until it runs out of threads (there is a raised shoulder on the axle for this purpose). All adjustments are to be made with the adjustable cone. The fixed cone must go on the bicycle's right, the adjustable cone must go on the bicycle's left. On the left side, the axle nut will keep the left cone from loosening up. If the wheel is accidentally reversed, so that the adjustable cone is on the right, it can tighten itself up and ruin the hub.

Raleighs also used an unusual wheel retention feature. The axle slot in the front fork end is keyhole shaped. Older hubs came with special axle nuts and washers. The axle nut had a shoulder which fitted through the axle washer and into the round part of the axle slot. Later hubs have a shoulder on the cone which fits into the round part of the axle slot, and it is necessary to spread the fork blades a bit to get the wheel in or out. This is the more common arrangement.

<b>These Are Real Bikes!</b><br>
Don't sneer at old 3-speeds. They are serious bikes, built for serious use. They are meant for utilitarian cyclists, and they are still extremely appropriate for riders who don't usually go more than a few miles at a time. They are particularly at home in stop-and-go traffic, because they can be shifted even while stopped. Their English heritage: full fenders, oil lubrication, and totally enclosed gear system, makes them relatively impervious to wet conditions. They may be heavy. That is not because they were built to be cheap, but because they were built to endure extremely rough usage and neglect. Properly cared for, they will outlast us all.

This picture (from SB's website) is from the 1969 Raleigh catelogue. It looks about right.
<br>
The gold foil banding on the seat tube is like mine and the cranks are similar - triangles, not swans. 
<br>
I paid $250 in 2012 (used). This page shows 67.95, which I assume is dollars but may be pounds. So clearly they have increased in value. 
<br>
$68 in 1969 is rated as say $425 in 2012 - so I paid a little more than 1/2 price for a used bike in V good condition, that sounds about right.
