I should note that while only the Bluesky link is shown, I'm on FB, Instagram and even have pretty much defunct X and Threads accounts. FB is now a junk mail regurgitation machine that actively hides friend interactions, Instragram is OK, Threads is wierdly boring and has an odd faux-intellectual-complaining vibe. So they are all basically dead. Instagram would be good as the 'photos first' media but as it's part of the aweful Meta-Zuckerberg umbrella one can only expect it to devolve steadily into a forcefeed of trash 'popular' content. So Bluesky it is, for now. I also follow Krugman and the Contrarian on Substack but after that inane alt-right posting by the substack founder/owner it is now too a suspect platform. Clearly there is a window open here for Bluesky to take the 'text media' spot that X has vacated (the X 'For You' tab now being a low-brow political trash-talking reality television program). Perhaps, I hope, other social platforms will come up to take the 'photo' spot (Instagram) and the 'friend chatwall' spot (old Facebook). 
<br>
<br>
It's always the same. The value of a social media network is based one 2 things: (1) How much it prioritizes friend content over stranger content. Friend content should always be first in priority and chronology. (2) Quality of stranger content. X, once Elon turned bad, is the case in point of a platform that used to promote interesting industry leaders but turned to promoting distasteful political lobbying. The algorithim is never a non-choice; it is always a cultivation of taste (in the case of Musk and Zetterberg, poor taste). 
<br>
<br>
Interestingly (2025) the new American FCC head is trying to argue that moderation by social media platforms is discriminatory and therefore illegal. The head of the FCC is so dumb that he does not see that moderation on a social platform is (a) just a function of algorithim, and therefore practiced by all social media, including those like X that do not fact check. Also (b), that moderation is just content promotion choice, in that same way that news programs on regular TV is content-by-choice. An intelligent FCC head would therefore recognize that outlawing social media fact checking and moderation would require abolition of news programs, which are all entirely fact-checking and content moderation. Ha ha ha the 2nd Trump admin is a wild pagentry of narrow-minded not clever people who really, really do not understand their jobs. It's like a bunch of children in adult jobs that they are just intellectually not able to handle.
