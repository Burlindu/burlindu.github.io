<b>LENGTH</b> from the seat mid to the grip mid is the most important measurement
<br>
(2)
<br>
<b>LEG</b> is the distance from the seat to the pedal (when pedal aligned with seat tube). This can be controlled by seatpost height and is the 2nd most important variable
<br>

I assume the grip is the same height as the seat. User may alter
<br>
(4)
<br>
If the head tube and seat tube are the same angle then raising the seat and raising the stem will have no effect on teh critial variable, the LENGTH (or RUN) of the user position
<br>
(5)
<br>
It's important to get the LENGTH right for a variable LEG - for a given user height, some will want a more or less upright position, or have differing proportions as to the lengths oftheir arms, legs and body. So you get a bike for the LENGTH you want and adjust the seat and stem height for your designed LEG. 
<br>
-----------------------
<br>
(5a)
<br>
Clearly my <b>LENGTH</b> and <b>LEG</b> are intended to replace STACK and REACH, which might be fine for sizing the frame only, however I care about sizing for user final position, not for industry comparison of manufactured goods. 
<br>
Also measuring the Seat Tube length for bike size obviously tells us pretty much nothing. Top Tube length (virtual / horizontal) does however give a good indication of LENGTH and can be used in a pinch, if you are prepared to consider also the seat position and stem/bar combo

QUESTION
<hr>
<br>
My sizing says that the length of the bike - seat to grip - is what is important when riding.
<br>
Standover and so seat tube matter for getting on and off. And do not matter at all while actually moving. So sizing a bike by the seat tube is super, super dumb.
<br><br>
(but of course may have made sense a million years ago when there were so few bike designs out there that seat tube height actually sort of corrolated with bike length, or when construction constraints were different)
<br>
<br>
<b>
So how do we size a bike for the rider in riding position?
<br>
This position extends from the seat to the grip. And the pedal.
</b>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
SOLUTION
<hr>
<br>
The Top Tube Length gives you frame length. That's a good start.
<br>
<br>
<b>
The Solution for bike leg reach is easy - just seated with leg out and the knee must be a bit bent at full extension (or you'll get stress injury over time). That's easy.
<br>
<br>
The solution of arm reach length (LENGTH) is not hard either. Find the bike you like, measure that length, and calculate the frame you want via the Top Tube, subtracting or adding - you must do this! - for the offset of the handlebar grips and seat fore-aft position. 
<br>
<br>
The hard part is finding a bike you like - best to have ridden a few. My Kona 19" was too long, and I did not know enough to just get a shorter stem. So my 17" Breezer was too short - and my long stem replacement was great for length but damaged the perfection of Joe Breeze handling. My 1966 Raleigh is very small but with the seat all the way back (too far, 2 mechanics have warned me) I get the slack seat angle and like and the bike RUN gets 1.5" longer for a say 22.5" run that I like. My Miele hybrid city bike had sizing I never thought about - meaning it was likely about right.
</b>
<br>
<br>
Assume the seat tube angle is good so the mid-seat is basically in line with the seat post and seat tube. Therefore you can do smaller adjustements for length by moving the seat forward and back.
<br>
<br>
*** If your seat tube angle is not to your liking (I like mine super slack, like under 70 degs) then you can set the seat back and fake-pretend your seat tube is still in line with the seat mid, and use a fake-artificial top tube length based not on the actual tube length (which is likely not horizontal anyway) but with the imaginary horizontal length from mid-head-tube to mid-seat-to-BB line.
<br>
<br>
Your next modifier is the grip position relative to the head tube.
<br>
<br>
I have an classic 3-speed handlebar and a short stem so my grip is right in line with the head tube, for a modifier of 0 (zero).
<br>
<br>A road bike with a 1" stem might have a modifier of +1". A Mountainbike with a straight flat bar and a 2" stem might have a modifier of +2. A crazy city bar may sway back behind the stem and actually have a negative effect on length.
<br>
<br>
<hr>
CONCLUSION
<hr>
<br>
So in the end you have what I call the bike <b>"LENGTH"</b>
<br>
which is the rider's actual riding length from the mid-seat to the mid grip, measured horizontally.
<br>
<br>
<b>
<i>
In effect, you're taking the conventional virtual (horz) top tube length and adding or subtracting any offet from the mid-seat position and mid-grip position. 
</i>
<br>
<br>
So the top tube is the best general measure of bike size, but really you have to add in the offset of the seat position and way more importantly (because of stem and bar variations) the offset of the grip position from the head tube line to really see the actual RUN or user length of the bike.
</b>
<br>
<br>
-----------------------
<br>
<br>
If you know basically what your preferred LENGTH is, and how slack you like your angles (if you are picky about that), then you can buy a bike by just setting the seat at the right height and measuring level from the grips to the mid-seat. 
<br>
<br>
- If your seat is in mid-position this gives you some nice leeway back and forth
<br>
- If your stem has a couple of inches on it you have some leeway to adjust by getting a bit longer or shorter stem
<br>
- If you have a city bar like mine that sweeps back it allows getting a stem with the same length as the sweep back of your bars to the grip. Get bars with a nice sweep back and you can have leeway, lots of mounting area... AND still have the grip in line with the head tube in neutral (zero) position.
<br>
- If the bike, like most bikes now, have a shallow seat tube angle (over 72 deg), you can cheat that angle by moving the seat all the way back. Note this will foul up the overall adjustability of the bike, as raising the stem and the seat together will now have them get closer together, due to the modern habit of a steeper seat tube than head tube. 
<br>
[[ I note here that steep seat tubes are great for climbing - for mountain bikers who climb in the seat and shoot downhill out of the saddle, so basically rarely riding a bike like a regular travel person, seated and pedaling on mostly level ground. Making watered-down hill bikes for general purpose riding is dumb becuase those geometries are designed for everything except seated travel on leverl ground ]]

EXTRA NOTES - HANDLING ETC
<hr>
<span class="regcase">
<br>
- A slack (lower angle) head tube makes for more steady handling. That's why modern downhill bikes are going BACK to a slack head tube. Better control! A steep head tube makes for twichy, hair trigger - prehaps unwanted both downhill at high speed and in city traffic.
<br>
<br>
- A slack seat tube makes for a nice relaxed seated position. A steep seat tube is great for climbing, which explains the rather unattractive combination of slack head tube (for downhill control) and steep seat tube (for climbing position) on modern mountain bikes that are made primarily for the hardest and least relaxing positions - super-fast downhill and super-hard uphill. 
<br>
<br>
- A long stem makes for twichy (again) steering. My old breezer was short (17"), so I swapped to a rather huge Specialized stem. The length was then correct but the maybe perfect Breezer handling was fouled - it was still a great bike, but more frantic and less steady on the turns. So now I like my grip at Raleigh 3-speed position, dead in line with the head tube (what I call zero position).
<br>
<br>
- Bike length is clearly user preference. A longer RUN puts the user in lower, less comfortable, more aerodynamic position. Like a road racer. A shorter bike has you sitting upright, which is fun and lets you see city traffic. Dutch bikes are oftern large looking, with big wheels and swooping sloped top tubes, but are kindly short (and brutally heavy, as momentum works great over rough cobblestones and Amsterdam is not known for having hills. Like no hills at all. It's a big cobblestone pancake.)
<br>
<br>
- I think sloping seats and handlebars is dumb, but I know, some people like it like that. A seat sloped forwards just indicates your bike is too long, and you don't like being perched on the narrow nose of the seat, so you tilt it nose-down to have the wide back push your bum into the handlebars. Sure it shortens the bike, but obviously you're going to needlessly be adding constant extra pressure onto your hands and arms.
<br>
<br>
- Sloping the grips down (towards you) I also think is dumb and bad looking. It looks 'ergonomic' like bad ergonomic tools look weirdly curved and un-tool like. Like a tool the handlebar and grip are a guiding mechanism, and level looks best and provides a good, logical and consistant turning radius mechanism. Rivendell bikes often show sloping grips, which I think is bad but clearly the Rivendell people do indeed care and think about rider comfort and utility.

I like 'em level - grips, seat and top tube as well, like on an old Richey bike. Ohhh, the sweet, short old Breezers, Richeys and Bridgestones (and G Fishers). Or the hilarious slack angles of old Raleighs and that original Joe Breezer starter bike, a 1941 Schwinn. The old cruisers and English town-and-country bikes were both great starting points for mountain bikes (which were cross-country bikes, not downhillers like now) and modern city bikes too, which are utility horses. For people like me, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson.
<br>
<br>
Now we just need to return to sensible slack equivalent angles, short top tubes, sensibly smallish wheels (to allow tires 1.5"+ & fenders and toe clear) (so 650b or 26") & add a Swytch powered front wheel and the city is your oyster. Also I have not used a dropper post but it sounds like an ideal tool for easier mount and dismount of city bikes (80+ year old Brian would likely agree, my oldest biking friend). And how anybody has a proper city bike without good old panniers for both work gear and quick grocery runs is just beyond me. I would like the back rack be part of the frame, to take away dangers of side movement on an overloaded pannier - or maybe a back rack that extends to secondary-double bolt onto the main triangle. See the Burl design section, for something like the Burl 68-68 or Burl 67-67.
