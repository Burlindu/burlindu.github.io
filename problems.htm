<b>CURRENT SITE CODE PROBS</b>
<br>
I like the spacing/location of the main page - not centered but left-justified some ways from the window edge. BUT - in phone view the move to furthur left usually has some issues.
<br>
Somehow I just have trouble getting teh DIVs to match the phone screen widtha nd provide an em or two padding on the right. Which should be well, pretty easy and basic. Ha ha Ha
<br>
<br>
<br><hr>
- Unwanted horizontal scroll just to the right of the screen edge in phone view
<br>
*** FIXED 2024-11 : CHANGED ZONE1 MIN WIDTH TO 21
<br>
*** tested by making media-screen max-width 360px (phone size)
<br>
*** In DEV mode showed that zone1DIV was overlapping the container on the right
<br>
*** zone1 had min-width of 23.5. Manually lowered until fits within 100% container div
<br>
*** that resulted in min-width 21em. I don't know why - padding? margins?
<br>
*** something to do with the spacing of button1's lined up? I dunno
<br>
*** 360px / 16pt = 22.5em so 21 leabes 1.5em unaccounted for


<br><hr>
- Maybe it's be better to have the column all center on the phone in media screen mode?
<br><hr>
- I also get a bit of wrap or text over-run on that right side in phone view

<b>NOTES</b>
<br>
I've been straight HTML since like 2000 ish?
<br>
(When I was working at startup wireless ISP Maxlink (28 GHz LMCS Spectrum Licences))
<br>
So I started pre-CSS and switched to css say 2006ish? And liquid formats after 2008ish?

<br>
<br>
But really it's just an occassional hobby, meaning my code is basic. I still end up with hilariously simple problems like spacing and margin (and wrap-around) problems, particularly when my css goes from normal view to 'media screen' width.
<br>
<br>
I don't want to use a template or a code-fixer program. I just want my HTMl on Notepad++ or similar.
<br>
<br>
So here I'll list problems I've had or am having, which may still be live problems since it's just my own recreational site and I have no external users to anser to............
<br>
<br>
I could also note that even my basic launch pad site, simple as it is, is now like 1,700 files (but only 28MB). That's what happens when you evolve one page for like 25 years, even if your 'coding skills' move very little over that time.........
