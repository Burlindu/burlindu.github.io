<br><br>• Test site for my links homepage
<br>• Just basic HTML that I figured out how to use in like 2010 and it still seems to work fine
<br>• SURF 1 was pre-HTML5 and pre-phone interface - so it was wide. So my biggest change was
<br>• (A) switching to CSS and 
<br>• (B) changing the interface so it detects and runs either in desktop square/wide format or on phone in small tall/narrrow format. 
<br><br>• It's like in the old days when THE VERGE was early in rejecting the idea of an app or separate site for phone use and just ran straight HTML5 for a suingle web and phone code/content source
<br>• My limited code I've always done in firstpage (Filezilla or something) - I may try the GITHUB interface here?
<br>• I've been using free server space on the Uni Almuni servers but surprise! Turns out they deleted all the many rarely used alumni email addresses, and those are the credentials I used for accessing the public Uni server (I expect that limited server room was intended for active students anyway, but nobody had bothered to block alumni use)
<br><br>• So Git hub for me is a test - can I run my landing homepage from here the same way I did from the Uni server?
<br>• The landing page is just an initial personal web interface. I know very little about code, but care a lot about basic user interface
<br>• It's about 15MB for the whole basic site, including all images, with minimal (mine only) traffic
<br>• If it works I may also upload other hobby web projects, like my old architecture school portfolio, etc
<br>• The primary landing site is SURF II, a derivative of the original BURLCRONE.COM & SURF I
<br>• Others would be free to use my landing site if they wanted (public URL), as it's just a graphical links page
