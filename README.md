Published via instruc at:
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart

This is my personal internet launch page
It's about 15MB total, with low traffic (only me)
Started as burlcrone.com and than SURF I in simple HTML (2000-2008)
& then added HTML with device dectrction & CSS
Allowing square/wide for desktop and tall/narrow for phone screen from one code set

Basic format folder/category boxes and smaller diect links
Boxes as per Windows Phone aesthetic

While the coding complexity is v low,, teh point is UI interface
Effective basic HTML5 (static) can make for a better web interface

May upload in separate folders portfolio sitte and other basic sites (Lauder, mom's launch, etc)
use of GITHUB started Nov 2024
Was using University of Toronto Alumni webspace - this disappreared 

when the uni elected to delete the many (unused, like mine) alumni email addresses
(said addresses were the security access to free server space)
