SURF II ETC

Personal & test webspace for Burl C

My basic static HTML5 on display

Early iterations burlcrone.com & SURF (I) lacked CSS & width control, being pre-2005ish (early internet)

SURF II is an internet portal / personal launch page

It functions like a desktop phone screen, functions on simple nesting with windows-phone like primary appearance

Different selectors are differentiated by size, shape & colour with simple nesting for categories in a convential manner


SURF II is about 15MB with minimal traffic (basically me)

Public; others would be free to use if wanted; it's just an interface sample
