SURF II ETC

Personal & test webspace for Burl C
SURF II is an internet portal / personal launch page
It functions like a desktop phone screen, more similar to old Windows phone than anything else
Different selectors are differentiated by size, shape & colour with simple nesting for categories in a convential manner

SURF II is about 15MB with minimal traffic (basically me)
It's public; others would be free to use if wanted
