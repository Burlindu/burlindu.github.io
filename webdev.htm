2024  --  UofT Alumni server space evaporated
<br>
Which was a good thing, as it had no SSL & so loaded with a security warning
<br>
<br>
Wanted a free web host space, if possible - but not some cheesey giveaway attached to some random commercial venture
<br>
Google has webspace but wants you to use their templates etc - I just want hard HTML5, no frills
<br>
Github! Turns out I already had an account & their free hosting is designated as Web Dev test space - essentially exactly what I want
<br>
<br>
Yes it's my landing page, for regular personal use, but that also means it's my basic user interface test bed
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
HTML CODING
<br>
is now done with Notepad ++ - Firstpage/Web Builder 4 appears to be falling apart & cannot be re-downloaded
<br>
Notepad ++ is the same but more stripped down - I like better
<br>
<br>
NOTE the SURF II site is still in "Surf2", but the LOCAL files linked to the WEB HOSTING SPACE is folder "burlindu.github.io"
<br>
so I can code offline, test at file:///C:/Users/Burl/<wbr>Documents/web/2018%20Surf2/<wbr>burlindu.github.io/index.htm 
<br>
Then you load up the GITHUB DESKTOP program, it detects the changes in the local folder & offers to upload/sync the HOSTING files
<br>
<br>
Nice! Just make sure you don't modify the HOSTED code alone or you muck up the sync
<br>
(The GITHUB web interface actually has a decent ability for code altering and one-at-a-time file upload/overwrite - but the syncing method is just less piecemeal)
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
So the methodology is:
<br>
<br>
(1) Load up in CHROME both <b>C:/Users/Burl/<wbr>Documents/web/2018%20Surf2/<wbr>burlindu.github.io</b> and <b>https://burlindu.github.io/</b>
<br>
<br>
(2) Load up NOTEPAD ++ and fool with the code in surf II in <b>burlindu.github.io</b> folder (NOT in the old Surf2 folder)
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> this will show a mismatch between the CHROME views of the local and web site files
<br>
<br>
(3) Load up the GITHUB DESKTOP and hit the Blue-ish buttons (there's a couple of hits, first bottom L and then a confirmation of some sort on the R) to sync the HOSTED files with the LOCAL files. Github.io now matches the new LOCAL code, or it should
<br>
<br>
(4) DOUBLE CHECK the upload is ok with local and web CHROME views the same - HOSTED web propogation will take a minute
<br>
<br>
(5) If impatient you can load the GITHUB WEB interface and check that your github.io now matches the new LOCAL code
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
OK this procedure works amazing. Hats off to the GITHUB DESKTOP software.
<br>
It regognizes every change instantly - even image over-writes with same file name - and does a full upload VERY fast.
<br> 
Also, it spots any files you removed and does auto deletion. really, it's amazing
