2024  --  UofT Alumni server space evaporated
<br>
Which was a good thing, as it had no SSL & so loaded with a security warning
<br>
<br>
(((However sadly I did lose a lot of content as a number of old webpages I had made only had a local copy on a backup drive that failed - I hadn't worried about the only remaining copy being on the UofT server. Ahhh, classic backup error of 'it will be OK, I have another copy'. As in one last copy. As in just begging for unexpected failure, ha ha ha.)))
<br>
<br>
Wanted a free web host space, if possible - but not some cheesey giveaway attached to some random commercial venture
<br>
Google has webspace but wants you to use their templates etc - I just want hard HTML5, no frills
<br>
Github! Turns out I already had an account & their free hosting is designated as Web Dev test space - essentially exactly what I want
<br>
<br>
Yes it's my landing page, for regular personal use, but that also means it's my basic user interface test bed
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
HTML CODING
<br>
is now done with Notepad ++ - Firstpage/Web Builder 4 appears to be falling apart & cannot be re-downloaded
<br>
Notepad ++ is the same but more stripped down - I like better
<br>
<br>
NOTE the SURF III site has the LOCAL files linked to the WEB HOSTING SPACE is folder "burlindu.github.io" - so the local folder is NOT 'SURF3' but instead the github folder.
<br>
so I can code offline, test at file:///C:/Users/Burl/<wbr>Documents/web/2024%20Surf3/<wbr>burlindu.github.io/index.htm 
<br>
Then you load up the GITHUB DESKTOP program, it detects the changes in the local folder & offers to upload/sync the HOSTING files
<br>
<br>
Nice! Just make sure you don't modify the HOSTED code alone or you muck up the sync
<br>
(The GITHUB web interface actually has a decent ability for code altering and one-at-a-time file upload/overwrite - but the syncing method is just less piecemeal)
<br> 
<br> 
<a href="https://validator.w3.org/" class="button3">W3C Valididator (I used to use)</a>
<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
So the methodology is:
<br>
<br>
(1) Load up in CHROME both <b>C:/Users/Burl/<wbr>Documents/web/2024%20Surf3/<wbr>burlindu.github.io</b> and <b>https://burlindu.github.io/</b>
<br>
<br>
(2) Load up NOTEPAD ++ and fool with the code in surf III in <b>burlindu.github.io</b> folder (NOT in the old Surf2 folder)
<br>
<b>NOTE</b> this will show a mismatch between the CHROME views of the local and web site files
<br>
<br>
(3) Load up the GITHUB DESKTOP and hit the Blue-ish buttons (there's a couple of hits, first bottom L 'COMMIT TO MAIN' and then a confirmation of some sort on the R, 'PUSH ORIGIN') to sync the HOSTED files with the LOCAL files. Github.io now matches the new LOCAL code, or it should
<br>
*** if the sync stalls it may be waiting for a required 'comment' text to be attached to the upload - small changes don't require this, bigger ones do
<br>
<br>
(4) DOUBLE CHECK the upload is ok with local and web CHROME views the same - HOSTED web propogation will take a minute
<br>
<br>
(5) If impatient you can load the GITHUB WEB interface and check that your github.io now matches the new LOCAL code
<br>
<br>

<br>
OK this procedure works amazing. Hats off to the GITHUB DESKTOP software.
<br>
It regognizes every change instantly - even image over-writes with same file name - and does a full upload VERY fast.
<br> 
Also, it spots any files you removed and does auto deletion. really, it's amazing
<br>
<br>
I note of course that usually this type of 'let's make it easy' software is in my view typically awful. Like a bad WYSIWYG webpage maker (which makes a mess of code you can't read or edit yourself). So usually I would just say 'go with an old-school FTP manual uploader'. However in this case - no way. The GITHUB DESKTOP works so well & is so quick & simple, it's amazing. The combo of Notepad++ & GITHUB server & GITHUB DESKTOP is for me a sort of dream combo of open, free softwares and server space too. It's so good, one assumes it cannot last. We will make hay while the sun shines.

TRIANGLIFY
<br>
SURF II uses an abstract geometric background that is 'Tessilated'.
<br>
In the first year of my M.Arc we had a project that asked for a 'tessilated' landscape & I made one out of triangles (made of paper) all modified in their geometries to make a 3d landscape out of an endless series of flat surfaces (mine was called 'between house'). It looked cool. I wanted a digital version - assemetrical triangles all fitting together in a field, differentiated by a natural colour gardiant (as if the light were hitting all the triangles at different angles - ie as if it we a flat image of an undulating, triangulated 3d surface). I figured some nerd on the internet might have what I was looking for. That nerd is Quinn Rohlf. His TRINGLIFY app (which was a high-school project he just posted on the web) was exactly what I was looking for in every way and his near-default image became my webpage background.
<br>
Later I was watching my favorite new show THE ORVILLE and saw that the TV producers had used TRINGLIFY to generate art for the starship. I Twitter'd Quinn R to let him know.
