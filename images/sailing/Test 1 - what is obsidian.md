Found Obsidian on my system

For notes? Code?
I'm not sure why I have it, this is a test to see what it is nor

Perhaps it is a formatting / org system for basic text notes

(ie do you can keep text in the simplest, most durable format - simple text - and still red and edit in a richer format? That's a guess. It's a good idea)

---

Obsidian uses .md files extension - it's MARKDOWN
Can be opened with regular txt file editor
It's basic text with some basic formatting features:

"In essence: A .txt file is the fundamental building block of text, while a Markdown file is a .txt file with a standardized, human-readable system for adding structure and formatting that can be easily processed and rendered.""
