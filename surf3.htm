SURF III is this site
<br>
<br>
For SURF III I went back to the old-school low res Ooriginal OG Surf I background from like 2007. It's the 'Long Arm' Surfer who a new girlfriend said: 'is that you?'. It is not me. But It looks me-ish. Perhaps it is me if I were represented by an avatar from the book Snowcrash
<br>
<br>
For 2025 I re-edited everything - new server means refereshed content
<br>
<br>
Here I've put a copy of the early 2025 ver for record. It's SURF III, the best yet, of course. And I added new ROUND links (ha ha ha - what an innovation!, ah ha). It's CSS rounded corners, so links to inside website files/folder are square
<br>
<br>
In particular I totally redid the Sailing and Biking sections, with a little java (that's a little over my head, I just use copy-paste code from W3C) and a new gambit of images taken from my mountains of gphoto albums and processed and formatted and sorted for easer practical access, here. I'm quite pleased with it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I should note in terms of server files I wanted to keep it small as the GITHUB sever space will be limited. However I also the made the site into a "double-copy" of burlindu.guithub.io and burlindu.guithub.io/0test. "0test"
 is a full online copy of the site. It's so when I am making major or complicated alterations I cna make them in 0test, upkoad to the web/server and test online, and then if all OK copy-paste the 0test files to the main burlindu.github folder and let it be live. It doubles my server space, doubles my upload process but..... gives me the security of a code duplicate and allows live testing from actual online server before going live on the main site code. It's worth it.
<br>
<br>
BUT............... burlindu.github + duplicates is now...... 276 MB and 6,978 files. Ha ha ha that's what you get when you run a personal vanity website for 26 years. I know I added a lot of images but 6000 files seems crazytown
