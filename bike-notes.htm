<b>NOTES</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
RALEIGH 3 SPEED
<br>
1968-9ish?
<br>
I had thoiught was maybe a 69 but images online of Eaton's catelogue has Gliders in 67 and 68 listed as having the uncommon grip shift - maybe those years.

<br><br>
<b>DROPOUTS</b>
REAR DROPOUTS HAVE RACK MOUNT BEHIND WHILE MOUNT, NOT ABOVE, SUGGESTING ACTUAL RALEIGH MANUFACTURE (PER THE GREAT SHELDON BROWN)

<br><br>
<b>SEAT POST</b>
<br>
SHELDON BROWN SAYS OLD STEEL BIKES MEASURE TUBE DIAMETER ON THE OUTSIDE
TYPICAL 1 1/8" (28.6) SEAT TUBE. (SO WHEN TUBES GOT THINNER SEATPOSTS GOT THICKER....)
<br>
ALL RALEIGH 3-SPEEDS ARE 1" 25.4mm SEAT POSTS

<br><br>
<b>FRONT WHEEL HUB</b>
<br>
<b>**** CHECK THIS RUINS HUB IF INSTALLED WRONG ****</b>
<br>
CHECK FRONT WHEEL - SB SAYS THE RALEIGH 3-SPEED FRONT HUB IS DIRECTIONAL & CAN BE INSTALLED BACKWARDS ON THE FORK - CHECK THIS!!

<br><br>
<b>BSD</b>
<br>
TIRES USE SHRADER TUBES 26 x 1 3/8". 
<br>
1 3/8 is 34.9mm (rim width)
<br>
ISO/ETRTO ARE STD TIRES/WHEEL SIZING. ISO IS THE BEAD SEAT DIAMETER - NOT THE VISIBLE RIM. IT IS THE SMALLEST DIAMETER OF THE TIRE INSIDE THE RIM. **RIM DIAMETER IS TYPICAL 10MM GREATER THAN BSD.
<br>
26 x 1 3/8" E.A.3 is ISO/ETRTO 590mm BSD. FRENCH EQUIV(?) IS 650A TYPE. A 700C WHEEL IS 622mm. 

<br><br>
<b>BB</b>
<br>
BOTTOM BRACKET IS LIKELY: Raleigh,  1 3/8" X 26 tpi,  CUPS R-L,  (34.9 x ? mm)
HANDLEBARS: OLD ENGLISH 3-SPEED SIZE, CLAMP IS 15/16ths, 23.8mm
<br>
GRIP AREA IS 22.2" or 7/8". NEW BARS ARE LIKELY 25.4mm AT THE CLAMP - TOO BIG!!
